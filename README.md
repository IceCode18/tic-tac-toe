# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple game built using Java, which includes a sleek user interface and sound effects. The game was created as a little project to practice Object-Oriented Programming principles, manipulating graphics, reading file inputs, adding audio effects, and recognizing mouse gestures.
 
<h3>How to Play</h3>
The game is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
A move can be made by clicking on the desired space on the board and using mouse gestures to draw the X or O token. The game will check for a winner or a tie after each move and display a message accordingly.
